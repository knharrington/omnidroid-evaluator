1. How you can break down a problem instance of the omnidroid construction problem into one or more smaller instances? You may use sprocket[t] to represent the number of sprockets used for part t, and you may use req[t] and use[t] to represent the collection of all parts required to build part t and all parts that part t is used to build, respectively. Your answer should include how the solution to the original problem is constructed from the subproblems.



2. What is the base cases of the omnidroid construction problem?



3. What data structure would you use to recognize repeated problems for omnidroids? You should describe both the abstract data structure, as well as its implementation.



4. Give pseudocode for a memoized dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the sprockets needed to construct an omnidroid.



5. What is the worst-case time complexity of your memoized algorithm?
